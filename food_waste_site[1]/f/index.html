            <h4>Food waste management systems are designed to reduce the amount of food waste created by businesses and households. These systems typically involve practices such as composting, recycling, and anaerobic digestion. Additionally, food waste
                management systems often include education and awareness campaigns to help people understand how their food choices impact the environment. Such systems can also involve infrastructure changes, such as the implementation of collection
                systems that make it easier for businesses and households to separate and properly dispose of their food waste. Every day, food businesses throw out high-quality, delicious food. It could be pallets of fresh bell peppers that aren’t the
                ideal shape. Or carrots that are a little crooked. Or milk that was over-ordered for a local school district. Point is, it’s food that could feed people rather than ending up in a landfill. In India, the larger the marriage, the larger
                the party, and also the additional stupendous the waste. No doubt weddings and banquets are an enormous supply of food wastage, however, restaurants and hotels conjointly contribute to food wastage. Nearly 14% of the total food produced
                globally is lost between the harvest and retail stages. India's contribution to wasted food, at 68.8 million tonnes annually, is 7% of the global total, per the United Nations Environment Programme's Food Waste Index Report 2021. <br>

            <h2>How can we manage food waste?</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="container-box">
            <h4> Here are few steps which we can follow in order to minimize food wastage: <br> 1) Reduce food waste at home by buying only what you need, planning meals, and storing food properly. <br> 2) Compost food scraps to create nutrient-rich soil for
                plants. <br> 3) Donate extra food to food banks, shelters, and other organizations. <br> 4) Recycle food packaging and containers. <br> 5) Use leftovers creatively in new meals and recipes. <br> 6) Contact your local government to find
                out what food waste programs are available in your area. <br> <br> Solutions for food waste management in India: <br> 1)

                <span>Recycle by Composting:</span> Food producers will solve 100% of their waste matter issues by merely organizing a good composting strategy. And doing therefore not solely eliminates waste, it saves you cash as a result of you don’t
                have to be compelled to “outsource” your compost production. <br> 2)

                <span>Turn Wasted Food into Animal Feed:</span> Cultivating compost is a method to recycle food, however it also can be drained of the bellies of cows, sheep, pigs, and alternative ethereal (themselves destined to become food). <br> 3)

                <span>Use Waste Food to provide Products:</span> From biofuels to liquid fertilizer, there are several helpful merchandises that may be factory-made from bound styles of waste foods, and infrequently “leftovers” of one company might be
                helpful in another business for the food scrap. <br> 4)

                <span>Source Reduction and Food Donation:</span> The easiest method to curtail waste matter is to easily turn out less whenever production is clearly resulting in waste. Once excess foodstuffs are still safe to eat, there will be hungry
                and poor people who realize it troublesome to afford decent food in today’s dear economy.

            <h2>Causes of Food Wasteage</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="container-box">
            <h4>
                1. <span>Over-Purchasing:</span> Many consumers buy more food than they can consume, driven by large package sizes, bulk discounts, and enticing sales. This leads to excess food that eventually goes to waste, contributing to food wastage.<br>                2. <span>Improper Storage:</span> Failing to store food correctly results in spoilage or contamination. Fruits and vegetables stored in unsuitable conditions deteriorate quickly, leading to their disposal. Proper storage practices are
                important to extend the shelf life of food and reduce wastage.<br> 3. <span>Misunderstanding Expiration Dates:</span> Misinterpretation of food expiration dates leads to premature discarding of perfectly edible food. Expiration labels
                often indicate peak quality rather than safety, causing unnecessary waste.
                <br> 4. <span>Cosmetic Standards:</span> Supermarkets and consumers reject edible food items based on appearance, disregarding their nutritional value. This emphasis on aesthetic criteria contributes to food wastage. <br>5. <span> Sizes:</span>                Large portion sizes in restaurants and home-cooked meals result in significant food waste. Excessive servings lead to uneaten food being thrown away, adding to the problem of wastage.<br> 6.<span> Inefficient Supply Chains:</span> Inefficiencies
                in transportation, distribution, and storage within the food supply chain contribute to food waste. Spoilage during transit and unsold goods that are discarded amplify the issue.<br> 7. <span>Lack of Awareness:</span> Many individuals
                remain unaware of the consequences of food waste and how to combat it. Lack of knowledge hinders effective waste reduction strategies, emphasizing the need for education and awareness initiatives.<br> 8. <span>Cultural Practices:</span>                Norms and traditions around food consumption can lead to wastage. In some cultures, leaving food on one's plate may be considered impolite, resulting in overordering at restaurants and disposal of leftovers. <br>9. <span>Economic Factors:</span>                Economic incentives, such as bulk discounts and low prices for large portions, encourage overconsumption and subsequent food waste.<br> 10.<span> Lack of Infrastructure:</span> In regions with inadequate infrastructure for food storage
                and transportation, significant food losses occur even before reaching consumers. Improved infrastructure is necessary to reduce such wastage.

                                        Food wastage is a massive global problem, with approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption going to waste each year. This amounts to billions of tons of food, representing a significant economic loss at the global level. Food wastage
                                        is estimated to cost hundreds of billions of dollars annually, impacting the entire food supply chain, from production to consumption.<br>The environmental consequences of
                                        food wastage are extensive. It contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss. Food wastage exacerbates environmental challenges and climate change, squandering the
                                        resources utilized in food production.<br>In stark contrast, while food is wasted on a large scale, millions of people around the world suffer from hunger and food insecurity. Addressing food wastage is crucial
                                        to reduce these pressing global issues. It is a social and ethical concern, raising questions about responsible resource use and equitable food distribution. Sustainable development principles emphasize meeting
                                        present needs without compromising the needs of future generations, making the reduction of food wastage a critical component of achieving sustainability.<br>Food supply chains have become increasingly globalized,
                                        with products transported across continents. Food wastage at any point in these complex supply chains has global implications, making it essential to address both food loss (occurring during production and distribution)
                                        and food waste (occurring at the consumer level).<br>Cultural and behavioral differences influence food wastage, highlighting the need to understand various consumer behaviors, dietary habits, and local practices
                                        when developing effective reduction strategies.<br>The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recognize the significance of reducing food wastage, including goals related to sustainable consumption
                                        and production patterns. International organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) provide guidance, research, and initiatives to combat food
                                        wastage on a global scale, emphasizing the importance of collaborative efforts.<br>Furthermore, reducing food wastage has direct implications for global food security. By minimizing waste, resources and food supplies
                                        can be more efficiently allocated to meet the nutritional needs of the world's growing population.<br>Increasing consumer awareness about the global implications of food wastage is vital for behavior change. Educating
                                        individuals about the economic, environmental, and social consequences of food wastage can inspire more responsible consumption practices at an individual level, contributing to the overall reduction of wasted food.
